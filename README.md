Mashup bits of different Youtube videos together for hilarity!

# Getting started

This app needs a web server forwarding all urls to `public/index.html`

This project has a docker setup that does all this.

## Docker

Install dependancies

```
yarn
```

Build & Run

```
yarn start
```

Now just browse `localhost`
